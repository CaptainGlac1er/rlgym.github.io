## RLGym Tools

While RLGym is usable for a variety of tasks immediately, many users may find it cumbersome to use with an existing Reinforcement Learning API like `stable_baselines3` (SB3),  or that it is lacking some function or tool that is useful for a specific application. Instead of bloating the API with various niche features, we have provided a secondary library called `rlgym-tools` which provides support for a number of applications, and a variety of unique reward functions and observation builders.

To install `rlgym-tools`, simply use pip:
```python
pip install rlgym-tools
```

and import the library as `import rlgym_tools`.
